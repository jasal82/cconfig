====================
HOW TO BUILD (Linux)
====================

Make sure the following packages are installed before building CConfig:
- gcc
- make
- cmake
- boost

To issue a build simply use the master Makefile in the distribution's root directory
with parameter 'release' or 'debug':

$ make release

OR

$ make debug

==============================
HOW TO BUILD (other platforms)
==============================

CConfig should be perfectly portable to other platforms (not tested though). Just
use your favourite compiler or IDE to build.

Make sure to set the include directories correctly. CConfig needs the following
additional include dir set:

antlr/include
